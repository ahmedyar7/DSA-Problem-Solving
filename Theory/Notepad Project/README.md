# C++ Notepad Implementation Analysis

## Core Components

### 1. Data Structures

- Custom `stack` implementation using a linked list
- `Node` template class for the stack nodes
- `Command` struct for undo operations with two types:
  - `ADD`: Records character additions
  - `REMOVE`: Records character deletions

### 2. Main Components

- Text editing area with cursor management
- Title bar showing application name and version
- Status bar displaying commands and messages
- Basic file operations (save)
- Undo functionality using command pattern

## Key Features

### Text Editor Functionality

1. **Text Input/Output**

   - Maximum text length: 5000 characters
   - Support for newlines and text wrapping
   - Visual cursor indication
   - Basic text insertion and deletion

2. **UI Components**

   - Title bar: "Ahmed Yar - Notepad v1.2"
   - Status bar with keyboard shortcuts
   - White editing area with black text
   - Window size: 1280x720 pixels

3. **Keyboard Commands**
   - F5: Save file
   - F6/ESC: Exit application
   - Ctrl+Z: Undo
   - Enter: New line
   - Backspace: Delete character

### Technical Implementation

1. **Graphics Handling**

   - Uses `graphics.h` for GUI elements
   - Custom rendering functions for UI components
   - Text rendering with proper spacing and wrapping

2. **Memory Management**

   - Stack implementation with proper cleanup
   - Dynamic memory allocation for undo operations
   - Template-based implementation for flexibility

3. **File Operations**
   - Simple file saving functionality
   - Saves to "notepad.txt" in the current directory
   - Basic error handling for file operations

## Design Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**

   - Used for implementing undo functionality
   - Each text modification is recorded as a command
   - Commands store both operation type and affected text

2. **Template Pattern**
   - Stack and Node classes are implemented as templates
   - Allows for type-safe operations
   - Reusable for different data types

## Limitations

1. **UI Constraints**

   - Fixed window size
   - Basic text rendering without advanced formatting
   - Limited font options

2. **Functionality**

   - No file opening functionality
   - Single undo stack (no redo)
   - Basic text operations only
   - No text selection or copy/paste

3. **Performance**
   - String operations might be inefficient for large texts
   - Complete screen redraw on each update
   - Limited to maximum text length of 5000 characters

## Potential Improvements

1. **Feature Additions**

   - Add file opening functionality
   - Implement redo operation
   - Add text selection and clipboard operations
   - Support for multiple files (tabs)

2. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Partial screen updates instead of full redraw
   - More efficient text storage and manipulation
   - Dynamic text buffer size

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Resizable window
   - Multiple font support
   - Line numbering
   - Syntax highlighting
