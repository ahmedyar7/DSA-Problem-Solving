### Problem Explanation:

The task is to remove the **Nth node from the end** of a singly linked list. The approach involves counting the total number of nodes in the list, then calculating the position of the node to be removed, and finally deleting that node.

### Approach:

1. **Count the total number of nodes** in the linked list. This can be done by iterating through the list once.
2. **Identify the node to be removed**: Once we know the total length of the list (`counter`), the node to be removed will be at the position `counter - n`. We need to find the node just before the one we want to remove.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If the node to be removed is the head node (i.e., if `counter == n`), then we directly modify the head of the list.
4. **Remove the Nth node from the end**: After finding the node just before the Nth node from the end, adjust its `next` pointer to skip the node that needs to be deleted.

### Dry Run Example:

#### Given:

- `head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
- `n = 2`

#### Steps:

1. **Count the total number of nodes**:

   - Initialize `counter = 0`, and set `temp = head`.
   - Traverse the list:
     - At node `1`: counter becomes `1`, move to the next node.
     - At node `2`: counter becomes `2`, move to the next node.
     - At node `3`: counter becomes `3`, move to the next node.
     - At node `4`: counter becomes `4`, move to the next node.
     - At node `5`: counter becomes `5`, move to `nullptr` (end of list).
   - **Total nodes (`counter`) = 5**.

2. **Find the node to be removed**:

   - The node to be removed is at position `counter - n = 5 - 2 = 3` (node `4` in the list).

3. **Traverse the list again to find the node just before the one to be removed**:

   - Initialize `temp = head`.
   - Move `temp` to the `3rd` node (node `3`):
     - Move to node `1`: `temp = 1`
     - Move to node `2`: `temp = 2`
     - Move to node `3`: `temp = 3` (this is the node just before node `4`).

4. **Remove the node**:

   - `temp->next` points to node `4`, so we set `temp->next = temp->next->next`, which effectively skips node `4`.
   - The new list becomes `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`.

5. **Return the updated list**:
   - The updated list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`.

### Edge Cases:

1. **Removing the head node**: If `n` equals the total number of nodes, we need to remove the head. The code handles this by checking `if (counter == n)`.
2. **List with one node**: If the list has only one node and `n = 1`, it will return `nullptr` after removing the head.
3. **List with two nodes**: If `n = 1`, the second node will be removed, and if `n = 2`, the first node will be removed.

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the list. We make two passes through the list (one for counting and one for traversing to the Nth node).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

### Conclusion:

This approach is efficient because it only requires two traversals of the linked list. The algorithm works even for edge cases like removing the head node and lists with only one node.
