# DSA

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and solving **LeetCode-style problems**. It contains a collection of solutions, implementations, and notes aimed at improving problem-solving skills and preparing for coding interviews.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`/DSA`**: Core implementations of fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **`/LeetCode`**: Solutions to various LeetCode problems organized by difficulty:
  - **Easy**
  - **Medium**
  - **Hard**
- **`/Notes`**: Detailed explanations, approaches, and dry runs for selected problems and concepts.

## 🚀 Goals

1. Strengthen understanding of DSA concepts through hands-on coding.
2. Solve a wide variety of LeetCode problems across different categories.
3. Develop efficient solutions with optimal time and space complexity.
4. Prepare for technical interviews by practicing frequently asked problems.
